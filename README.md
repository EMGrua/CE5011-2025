# CE5011

This repository contains all of the assignments for module CE5011. The assignments are divided into 3 sections, each one corrisponding to a different section in the module. 
Note that each section contains various example notebooks, as well as the assignment for that section. 

I suggest you download the code for the current section we are exploring and run the code in Google Colab. 
When you are done with the assignment, you can push it back to this repo by creating your own branch. 

For any questions or problems, don't hesitate to create a thread on the "General Discussion". You can find "General Discussion" in Brighspace, under module CE5011 -> Module Overview -> General Discussion.
